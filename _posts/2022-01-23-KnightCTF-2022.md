Hello, In this post I'll explain 3 out of web challenges I encountered in KnightCTF 2022 web category.

## Find Pass Code - 1 
### Description

### Recon + Exploitation
This is how the website looks.

Opening source code shows:

Submitting source param shows php source code:

To put it simply it doesn't matter what is the pass_code as long as strcmp gets us a 0, so we just need something to return 0 or NULL which are equivalent in PHP. Submitting pass_code as an array lets strcmp returns 0 and bypass the check.
This bypass is possible because of loose comparison where data types aren't checked.

## Find Pass Code - 2
### Description

### Recon + Exploitation
This challenge has same front page as the previous one.
Opening source code shows:

Submitting source param shows php source code:

When comparing strings using == PHP will attempt to parse the string as a number. Hence, string like "0e2" will be considered as the value 0 in scientific notation. We need to find a string which both the string itself and its MD5 hash match the pattern `0e[0-9]+`.

$old_pass_codes has blacklisted some known strings so we've to find others.

Searching [online](https://blog.csdn.net/u013512548/article/details/108213295), provided another string `0e1137126905` that also has this property but, not blacklisted which will gets us the flag.

##  Can you be Admin? 
### Description

### Recon + Exploitation
Sending `GET /` request shows:
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/10.png)
Altering UserAgent shows:
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/11.png)
Altering Referer shows a base64 enoded cookie name and value.
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/12.png)
Decoding it shows:
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/13.png)
The same request which got us the cookie contains a strange long non-alphanumeric stuff.

Putting that in [de4js](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) got us:
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/15.png)
Which was identified as ASCII85 by [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier)
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/16.png)
Then we decoded it with [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-85-encoding), which gave us a user and password.
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/17.png)
We entered these credentials in the login form and got:
![](../../assets/img/posts/2/18.png) 
Then we submitted base64(User_Type)=base64(Admin) as a cookie to the same endpoint and got the flag.
